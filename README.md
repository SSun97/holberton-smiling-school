# Implement a design from with bootstrap
## Holberton School Smiling school demo

In this project, we will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that we learned previously.

We won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that we want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:
This website is responsive, the layout is changed with the size of the screen. ✨
